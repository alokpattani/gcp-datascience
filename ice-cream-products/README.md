# Ice Cream Products - Asset Generation and Recommendations at Scale

This folder contains [BigQuery](cloud.google.com/bigquery) SQL code showing how to use generative AI with [this well-curated Kaggle dataset of 240+ ice cream products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset/data) to create assets (short product descriptions, alt text, and review summaries) and recommendations (which products are similar to a given product) at scale, leveraging the integration of [Vertex AI](cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) with BigQuery on [Google Cloud](cloud.google.com).

The SQL scripts in this folder are numbered in order of how they should be run to create the results, with the full process outlined in the following 2 blog posts:
